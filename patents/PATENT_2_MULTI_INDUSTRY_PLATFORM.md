## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to multi-industry blockchain platforms, specifically to a unified quantum-resistant infrastructure that serves healthcare, banking, industrial, financial, and enterprise applications with industry-specific adaptations.

### Background Art

Current blockchain solutions are typically designed for single-industry use cases, requiring separate implementations for different verticals. Healthcare, banking, industrial IoT, financial services, and enterprise applications each have unique requirements for data privacy, compliance, and security. There is no unified platform that provides quantum-resistant security across multiple industries while maintaining industry-specific compliance and functionality.
