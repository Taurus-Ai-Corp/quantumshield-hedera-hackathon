## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to artificial intelligence systems for regulatory compliance, specifically to an AI-powered automated compliance system for quantum-resistant blockchain migration that detects regulatory changes and automates compliance checking.

### Background Art

Current compliance systems for blockchain migration require manual monitoring of regulatory changes, manual compliance checking, and manual audit trail generation. There is no automated AI-powered system that detects regulatory changes, checks compliance automatically, and generates audit trails for quantum-resistant blockchain migration.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides an AI-powered automated compliance system that uses generative AI to monitor regulatory changes, check compliance automatically, and generate audit trails for quantum-resistant blockchain migration processes.

### Objects and Advantages

1. Automated regulatory change detection
2. AI-powered compliance checking
3. Automated audit trail generation
4. Gen AI for quantum compliance
5. Real-time compliance monitoring
