## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and offline payment systems, specifically to a quantum-resistant offline CBDC protocol using state channels with quantum-safe conflict resolution.

### Background Art

Current CBDC implementations face challenges with offline transactions, requiring online connectivity for verification. Additionally, existing offline CBDC systems do not provide quantum-resistant security, making them vulnerable to future quantum computing attacks. There is no solution that combines offline CBDC functionality with quantum-resistant cryptography and unlimited offline transactions.

### Objects and Advantages

1. Unlimited offline CBDC transactions
2. Quantum-resistant state channel security
3. Quantum-safe conflict resolution
4. Offline-to-online quantum sync
5. ML-DSA signed CBDC transactions
