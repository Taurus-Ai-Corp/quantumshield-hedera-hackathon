# Demo Source Code - QuantumShield AI Agents

**Hedera Ascension Hackathon 2025 Submission**  
**Track: AI & Agents**

## Overview

This folder contains **demo/example implementations** demonstrating the core concepts of QuantumShield AI Agents. These are simplified versions that show the implementation approach while protecting core intellectual property.

## Files

- `quantum-crypto-demo.js` - ML-DSA signature demo
- `hedera-integration-demo.js` - Hedera HTS/HCS integration demo
- `ai-agent-demo.js` - Verifiable AI agent implementation demo
- `smart-contract-demo.sol` - Smart contract example

## Note

These are **demonstration implementations** created during the hackathon period (Nov 3-21, 2025) to show:
- How ML-DSA signatures work with Hedera
- How AI agents can be verified on-chain
- Integration approach with Hedera services

**Full production implementation** includes additional features, optimizations, and IP-protected components not shown in these demos.

## Usage

See individual files for usage examples and documentation.
